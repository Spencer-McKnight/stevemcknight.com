              <p>
                Many people are deeply unhappy with their employment situations and 'dream' 
                about doing something better with their lives. I was no different, right up 
                until I had a stress related medical crisis where my GP told me to take a 
                holiday and change my life or else prepare for an early grave.
              </p>
              <p>
                Up until that moment I would grumble about my job, but I was addicted to 
                the 'prestige' and 'pay cheque', despite the 'pay pain' that came with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet, as I reflected on what was most important to me, I realised that 
                <strong>being paid a lot of money to be unhappy simply didn't make sense.</strong> 
                There had to be a better way to approach life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aside from the medical urgency to change my lifestyle, I also rationalised 
                my decision to move away from my career on the basis that if worst came to 
                worst, I could always go back and get a job in accounting.

                Truth be told, I was already living my worst case scenario (doing a job simply 
                for the pay), so any improvement was a step in the right direction.

                The moment I knew I was financially free was when the net income from my 
                property investments exceeded the salary I was earning as an accountant. 
                <em>That was a great day!</em>

                Make no mistake – the path to financial freedom has many twists and turns, 
                and it is easy to stumble off course and become lost. This is natural, but 
                the sooner you find your way back, the better.

                Strangely, <strong>experiencing success is a significant danger to your 
                larger wealth goals</strong>, because as your wealth grows, the pain that 
                was present when you started gradually fades resulting in potential stalled progress.

                So, how do you stay motivated? There's a plethora of books and courses you 
                can read or study, but to me the key to pushing on is to remain connected 
                to the reason <em>why</em> achieving your big picture goal is an important priority.

              <p>Two pieces of advice I can offer are:</p>

                  If you don't know 'why' you're trying to do something, it's almost 
                  impossible to decipher the best 'how' for achieving it.

                  People give up when the pain of going forward becomes greater than the 
                  pain of going back. Pain (or at least significant dissatisfaction) is 
                  probably what propelled you into action in the first place, so in order 
                  to keep making the effort required for progress, maintain that 'pain' 
                  perspective as a reference point.

            <div class="qa-item__answer" data-animate="fade-up" data-delay="200">
              <p>I believe that there are <strong>two quests in life: control and significance.</strong></p>
              <p>
                In the first quest, we seek to master and control our destiny. That is, 
                rather than having to do something, we want choice. This might be something 
                primal, like getting food, water and shelter. Or it could be freedom from 
                financial pressures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once we have ourselves sorted out, we start to think about the impact or 
                legacy we have on others. This is the quest for significance or life meaning.
              </p>
              <p>
                These two quests are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but undoubtedly one 
                will demand more of your attention than the other depending on your circumstances.

                With the benefit of hindsight, the second journey can give meaning and context to the first. 
                It's hard to succeed in Quest #1 without some grasp of Quest #2.

                The truth is that, as I've said, the road to financial freedom has many 
                twists and turns. Sometimes, bad and unexpected things happen. For example, 
                I once owned a property that was demolished by the local council without any 
                prior notice… or so I thought.

                They had actually sent two registered letters that had been received by my 
                office but misfiled. Obviously that was a problem, but it was also the 
                chance to review and improve the internal office communication.

                <strong>Investing is about risk management, not risk avoidance.</strong> 
                Things can and will go wrong, and when they do, you may find that how you 
                respond actually makes you a better person... once the shock wears off.

                  <strong>Thinking more money will make them happier.</strong> Money can help you look happier, but it will never meet the deepest needs of your soul. Filling your life with things that deliver temporal rather than eternal significance will only deliver temporary relief.

                  <strong>Concentrating on 'how' rather than 'why'.</strong> It's much smarter to let your 'why' dictate the best 'how', rather than having your 'how' dictate your 'why'. The strategy is the mechanism for making money, but it is not the reason for making money.

                  <strong>Failing to start.</strong> You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great. The lack of certainty about how to start is because there is a lack of certainty about why starting is a priority.

                  <strong>Overlooking management.</strong> The real money is made by maximising how the asset is owned and managed, not just how it was acquired. Any idiot can sign their name, but it takes skill to make the most money, in the quickest time, for the least risk.

                Our two biggest constraints are our time and money, so if we can leverage 
                off other people's time and money, then the glass ceiling of our own limited 
                resources can be overcome.

                So, the question to ask is: <strong>how can I access more time, and how can

                  <strong>Leveraging Time</strong> — Outsource and delegate but retain management and control. Rather than spending hours searching for deals, create a deal profile and email it to all the agents in your target area. Multiple people looking in multiple areas without costing you a cent.
