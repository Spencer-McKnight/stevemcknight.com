              <p>
                Many people are deeply unhappy with their employment situations and 'dream' 
                about doing something better with their lives. I was no different, right up 
                until I had a stress related medical crisis where my GP told me to take a 
                holiday and change my life or else prepare for an early grave.
              </p>
              <p>
                Up until that moment I would grumble about my job, but I was addicted to 
                the 'prestige' and 'pay cheque', despite the 'pay pain' that came with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet, as I reflected on what was most important to me, I realised that 
                <strong>being paid a lot of money to be unhappy simply didn't make sense.</strong> 
                There had to be a better way to approach life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aside from the medical urgency to change my lifestyle, I also rationalised 
                my decision to move away from my career on the basis that if worst came to 
                worst, I could always go back and get a job in accounting.

                Truth be told, I was already living my worst case scenario (doing a job simply 
                for the pay), so any improvement was a step in the right direction.

                The moment I knew I was financially free was when the net income from my

                Make no mistake – the path to financial freedom has many twists and turns, 
                and it is easy to stumble off course and become lost. This is natural, but 
                the sooner you find your way back, the better.

                Strangely, <strong>experiencing success is a significant danger to your 
                larger wealth goals</strong>, because as your wealth grows, the pain that 
                was present when you started gradually fades resulting in potential stalled progress.

                So, how do you stay motivated? There's a plethora of books and courses you 
                can read or study, but to me the key to pushing on is to remain connected 
                to the reason <em>why</em> achieving your big picture goal is an important priority.
              </p>
              <p>Two pieces of advice I can offer are:</p>

                <p>
                  If you don't know 'why' you're trying to do something, it's almost 
                  impossible to decipher the best 'how' for achieving it.

                  People give up when the pain of going forward becomes greater than the 
                  pain of going back. Pain (or at least significant dissatisfaction) is 
                  probably what propelled you into action in the first place, so in order 
                  to keep making the effort required for progress, maintain that 'pain' 
                  perspective as a reference point.

              <p>I believe that there are <strong>two quests in life: control and significance.</strong></p>
              <p>
                In the first quest, we seek to master and control our destiny. That is, 
                rather than having to do something, we want choice. This might be something 
                primal, like getting food, water and shelter. Or it could be freedom from 
                financial pressures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once we have ourselves sorted out, we start to think about the impact or 
                legacy we have on others. This is the quest for significance or life meaning.
              </p>
              <p>
                These two quests are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but undoubtedly one 
                will demand more of your attention than the other depending on your circumstances.

                With the benefit of hindsight, I think there's a stronger connection between 
                the two journeys than I first realised because the second journey can give 
                meaning and context to the first journey. That is, it's hard to succeed in 
                Journey #1 without some grasp of Journey #2.

                The truth is that, as I've said, the road to financial freedom has many 
                twists and turns. Sometimes, bad and unexpected things happen. For example, 
                I once owned a property that was demolished by the local council without any 
                prior notice… or so I thought.

                They had actually sent two registered letters that had been received by my 
                office but misfiled. Obviously that was a problem, but it was also the 
                chance to review and improve the internal office communication.

                <h3>Thinking that having more money will make them happier.</h3>
                <p>
                  To borrow another phrase from Brendan Nichols: 'money doesn't buy happiness, 
                  but everyone has the right to figure that out for themselves.'
                </p>
                <p>
                  Money can help you look happier, but it will never meet the deepest needs 
                  of your soul. Happiness relates to being content; filling your life with 
                  things that deliver temporal rather than eternal significance will only 
                  deliver temporary relief.
                </p>

                <h3>Concentrating on 'how' rather than 'why'</h3>
                <p>
                  Because the goal is 'how' to have more money, rather than 'why' is more 
                  money a priority, it's easy to waste time looking for quick fixes rather 
                  than permanent solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The strategy is the mechanism for making money, but it is not the reason 
                  for making money. It's much smarter to let your 'why' dictate the best 
                  'how', rather than having your 'how' dictate your 'why'.
                </p>

                <h3>Failing to start</h3>
                <p>
                  It's been said that 'you don't have to be great to start, but you have to 
                  start to be great.'
                </p>
                <p>
                  Again, the lack of certainty about how to start is because there is a lack 
                  of certainty about why starting is a priority.

                <h3>Money follows management</h3>
                <p>
                  All too often property investors are overly focused on what they're buying, 
                  when the real money is made by maximising the value proposition of how the 
                  asset is owned and managed (and ultimately sold), as opposed to how it was acquired.
