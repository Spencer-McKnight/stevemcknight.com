How This Site Started
PropertyInvesting.com was born out of Steve McKnight’s need to communicate honest and no-nonsense information about successful real estate investing. 

After learning how to create a website in late 2002 PropertyInvesting.com went live and has been updated numerous times since with vastly expanded resources and facilities.

However, while there is a new look and feel, the aim of Property Investing.com remains the same – to deliver information about what works (and what doesn’t) in property investing.

Be sure to spread the good news about this site by recommending us to your friends.

Structure of This Site

General level: This includes free information within the site.
Subscriber information: Access to current and back issues to the PropertyInvesting.com e-publication titled ‘Insider’. Access to this e-publication is currently free of charge.
Purpose for this Site
You have a right to receive impartial information that will educate you about how to become wealthier through property investing. Sadly, a lot of the product on offer in the market place talks about doing “it”, when in fact the promoters haven’t actually done “it” in practice.

The PropertyInvesting.com community exists to share amongst its members what works… and what’s a waste of time and money. No other site I’ve ever visited or heard about provides the level of detail you’ll find here. It has cost a significant amount of time and money to set this up, but if you find one piece of information beneficial, then it’s been worthwhile. The specific goals for the site are:

To provide information about property investing to people who are interested in improving their wealth through real estate, and
Create a network of people who would like to be shown “how to do it” by people who are actually doing it, rather than relying on unproven systems which may or may not work.
