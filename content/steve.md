Are you frustrated by your lot in life? Wish you had more money, more job satisfaction, more love, more hair (sigh)?

Normally, after asking such questions, marketeers would launch into a spiel about how their miracle product could make you wealthier, slimmer, prettier, hairier, whatever, and how much happier you'd be having achieved that state (after buying their thing, of course).

Well, you can relax! I'm not here to sell you anything. Instead I'd like to offer you a word of encouragement, wrapped up in an unusual true story. Here goes!

Profoundly Simple.
Recently, while on the train into town for a business meeting, I passed the time by skimming through a synopsis on (of all things) the principles of Alexander Technique.

As I came to the end of the text, my eyes became drawn to the following remarkably simple, yet amazingly profound statement
Ahhh... keen to see how the story ends, are you?
The statement I was talking about was this...

“...you can't change, and stay the same while you do it.”

Okay, it's true, the statement may not appear to be a mind-blowing revelation, but as I re-read it for the third and fourth time, I couldn't help but nod in agreement and wonder if the writer hadn't stumbled across a 'secret' powerful enough to turn your worst failure into your best success...

Can I ask you to do something? Try to identify one thing you've wanted to accomplish for a while, but haven't as yet been able to achieve. Keep it simple if you can: losing a few kilos, paying off debt, more time with the kids, working less, etc. (my wife said more time in the garden).

Got it? If so then ask yourself this: what did you give up to get it? If the answer is nothing, then you've made the mistake of attempting change while staying the same as you did so.

See, change implies giving something up (literally - changing), yet all too often we want the result without paying the price to get it. This brings me to one of my favourite sayings:

“The more you do of what you've done, the more you'll get of what you've got.”

Now let's do another exercise. This time think of a situation when you've achieved a significant success: sporting accomplishment, receiving an award, promotion, pay increase, good investing outcome, got married, etc.

As you think about it, can you identify how you changed to position yourself for success? Took a risk, worked harder, studied more, etc.

It appears to me that you already know how to be successful, but that you have either not realised it, or else forgotten it. What's the secret? I've already told you! It's:

“...you can't change, and stay the same while you do it.”

Friend, success isn't only for the fortunate few. It's yours for the taking too - but not until you decide that your future is more important than the past, and that your character is more important than your comfort.

How much time do you spend on improving your character? How does that compare with the time you spend on your comfort?

Perhaps the motivation you're looking for can be summed up in a personal revelation I had during a tough time in my life:

“People give up when the pain of going forward is greater than the pain of going backwards.”

Either way there's pain - but if you push through there is pleasure. Retreat and at best there is comfort, and no one achieved greatness from a position of comfort!

I hope this short story and few handy quotes have provided food for thought and maybe even a little motivation or desire to 'raise the bar' in your life - perhaps for a minute, maybe even for an hour. More long-lasting results will require your input, and a commitment to develop your character by being brave enough to not stay the same anymore.

God bless,

About

About Steve McKnight
Aside from being an accomplished investor, Steve McKnight is one of Australia's most successful business authors and acclaimed public speakers.

McKnight (1972 - ) holds a Bachelor of Business (Accounting) and is a chartered accountant. He began his career working in Audit at Deloitte (1993-1995), before beginning his own accounting practice (1999-2004) in partnership with David Bradley.

Property Investor
After attending a wealth creation seminar in May 1999, McKnight began investing in positive cash flow real estate, beginning his property portfolio with a $44,000 3-bedroom house in Ballarat, Victoria. What was special about the property was that after all expenses, the rent provided a small surplus.

"The plan was simple", says McKnight. "If we could own enough positive cash flow properties, then the surplus income could be used to replace the earned income from the accounting practice, at which point Dave and I would be financially free."

Using the money made in their accounting practice, Bradley & McKnight began buying positive cash flow rental homes and blocks of units in Ballarat, La Trobe Valley, Tasmania and New Zealand. Aside from rental income, some of the properties were on-sold using vendor finance to potential home buyers who could prove creditworthiness but lacked a deposit.

“To date, McKnight's investment entities have bought upwards of 500 properties, and over the 12 years he has been investing, he's averaged a new purchase every 9 days.”

Infopreneur
In 2001, McKnight co-founded the website www.propertyinvesting.com with a view of assisting other investors with independent yet practical and profitable information about how to use real estate to create wealth. "I can remember when there were 16 people getting the newsletter", McKnight recalls. Today there are over 90,000 members. McKnight remains a director and continues to write content and speak at events run by the company.

Author
In 2003, McKnight received an unexpected call from Wright Books (an imprint of John Wiley & Sons), canvassing the idea of writing a property book. Willing to give something new a go, McKnight wrote his first book (From 0 to 130 Properties in 3.5 Years) on his PC in less than 12 weeks. The book went on to become Australia's #1 selling real estate book (currently having sold over 200,000 copies), and was awarded the status of 'Business Book of the Year' in 2004.

McKnight wrote the sequel (From 0 to 260+ Properties in 7 Years) in 2006, before being asked to revise his first book for re-release in 2010. McKnight's books continue to receive high acclaim and remain among Australia's best selling real estate titles.

Expert, Commentator & Speaker
McKnight is regarded as one of Australia's foremost property experts. He has been extensively featured on TV, radio and print media, and he continues to be regularly quoted in the press. As a highly acclaimed speaker, McKnight has been invited to share his thoughts at events throughout Australia and across the globe.

Current Activities
In recent times, McKnight has turned to property investing in the United States, acquiring over 150 properties in less than 18 months.

"It's like history is repeating itself. There's a plethora of positive cash flow properties on offer, and I'm making hay while the sun shines!"

Strategic Opportunities (Growth & Income) Fund
McKnight is involved with the Strategic Opportunities (Growth & Income) Fund (SOGIF), an ASIC registered managed investment scheme that seeks to generate growth and income returns through a diversified portfolio of investments. The Fund invests in cash and money market instruments, bonds, strategic equity investments, and entrepreneurial property opportunities - both direct real estate and unlisted property trusts.

The Fund is managed by Plantation Capital Limited, which holds an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL 339481). For more information about SOGIF, including the Product Disclosure Statement and investment details, visit [https://sogif.au](https://sogif.au).

McKnight's books are available in bookstores, and online at www.PropertyInvesting.com

What motivated you to risk leaving a comfortable job to become a property investor? Was there a key moment where you knew you were committed to becoming "financially free"?
Many people are deeply unhappy with their employment situations and ‘dream’ about doing something better with their lives. I was no different, right up until I had a stress related medical crisis where my GP told me to take a holiday and change my life or else prepare for an early grave.

Up until that moment I would grumble about my job, but I was addicted to the ‘prestige’ and ‘pay cheque’, despite the ‘pay pain’ that came with it.

Yet, as I reflected on what was most important to me, I realised that being paid a lot of money to be unhappy simply didn’t make sense. There had to be a better way to approach life.

Aside from the medical urgency to change my lifestyle, I also rationalised my decision to move away from my career on the basis that if worst came to worst, I could always go back and get a job in accounting.

Truth be told, I was already living my worst case scenario (doing a job simply for the pay), so any improvement was a step in the right direction.

The moment I knew I was financially free was when the net income from my property investments exceeded the salary I was earning as an accountant. That was a great day!

How did you stay focused and motivated to keep moving forward with your investment goals, and avoid falling prey to "moments of weakness"?
Make no mistake – the path to financial freedom has many twists and turns, and it is easy to stumble off course and become lost. This is natural, but the sooner you find your way back, the better.

Strangely, experiencing success is a significant danger to your larger wealth goals, because as your wealth grows, the pain that was present when you started gradually fades resulting in potential stalled progress.

Perhaps business guru Brendan Nichols, a man I tremendously respect and admire, said it best when he commented that “the enemy of a great life is a good life”.

So, how do you stay motivated? There’s a plethora of books and courses you can read or study, but to me the key to pushing on is to remain connected to the reason why achieving your big picture goal is an important priority.

Two pieces of advice I can offer are:

If you don’t know ‘why’ you’re trying to do something, it’s almost impossible to decipher the best ‘how’ for achieving it; and

People give up when the pain of going forward becomes greater than the pain of going back. Pain (or at least significant dissatisfaction) is probably what propelled you into action in the first place, so in order to keep making the effort required for progress, maintain that ‘pain’ perspective as a reference point.

These two points are among the most important realisations I have ever had.

How has your outlook and focus changed over time as your investing income grew to the point you no longer needed your job? And what keeps you motivated now that you're no longer "chasing a paycheque"?
I believe that there are two quests in life: control and significance.

In the first quest, we seek to master and control our destiny. That is, rather than having to do something, we want choice. This might be something primal, like getting food, water and shelter. Or it could be freedom from financial pressures.

Once we have ourselves sorted out, we start to think about the impact or legacy we have on others. This is the quest for significance or life meaning.

These two quests are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but undoubtedly one will demand more of your attention than the other depending on your circumstances.

Applying this theory to my situation, my first quest was all about controlling my finances as a way of controlling my work environment.

At the same time I was experimenting with my faith and wondering what the ‘big picture’ of life may look like. Once I had achieved my financial goal, I had more time to work on my quest for life meaning.

With the benefit of hindsight, I think there’s a stronger connection between the two journeys than I first realised because the second journey can give meaning and context to the first journey. That is, it’s hard to succeed in Journey #1 without some grasp of Journey #2.

So, what keeps me motivated today? I still have financial needs and goals, but they are no longer primarily about me and my comfort, but rather how I can use my skills to help the needs and comforts of others.

Every investor will face setbacks and challenges in their investing journey. What advice can you give someone who is struggling to move forward after experiencing a big investing mistake?
Provided it’s not fatal, I take the view that something is only a mistake if it happens more than once. The first time is a learning opportunity and a chance to improve.

The truth is that, as I’ve said, the road to financial freedom has many twists and turns. Sometimes, bad and unexpected things happen. For example, I once owned a property that was demolished by the local council without any prior notice… or so I thought.

They had actually sent two registered letters that had been received by my office but misfiled. Obviously that was a problem, but it was also the chance to review and improve the internal office communication.

Investing is about risk management, not risk avoidance. Things can and will go wrong, and when they do, you may find that how you respond actually makes you a better person... once the shock wears off.


What are the most common mistakes you see people making when starting in property investment?
Here are four:

Thinking that having more money will make them happier.
To borrow another phrase from Brendan Nichols: ‘money doesn’t buy happiness, but everyone has the right to figure that out for themselves.’

Money can help you look happier, but it will never meet the deepest needs of your soul. Happiness relates to being content; filling your life with things that deliver temporal rather than eternal significance will only deliver temporary relief.

Concentrating on ‘how’ rather than ‘why’
Because the goal is ‘how’ to have more money, rather than ‘why’ is more money a priority, it’s easy to waste time looking for quick fixes rather than permanent solutions.

The strategy is the mechanism for making money, but it is not the reason for making money.

For instance, renovating can work for some but not for others. The strategy is not the problem, but rather the application of the strategy.

It’s much smarter to let your ‘why’ dictate the best ‘how’, rather than having your ‘how’ dictate your ‘why’.

Failing to start
It’s been said that ‘you don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.’

Again, the lack of certainty about how to start is because there is a lack of certainty about why starting is a priority.

Money follows management
I could go on all day, but let’s finish up here with a forth and final comment: money follows management.

All too often property investors are overly focused on what they’re buying, when the real money is made by maximising the value proposition of how the asset is owned and managed (and ultimately sold), as opposed to how it was acquired.

Any idiot can sign their name, but it takes skill to make the most money, in the quickest time, for the least risk.


When you started as an investor, you had never bought a property, and only had modest savings in the bank - but you came up with some clever strategies to fund your property purchases. What are some of the best ways to fund deposits for properties without living off 2-minute noodles?
Leverage is powerful because it allows you to overcome the reality of your constraints and achieve more with less.

Our two biggest constraints are our time and money, so if we can leverage off other people’s time and money, then the glass ceiling of our own limited resources can be overcome.

So, the question to ask is: how can I access more time, and how can I access more money?

In regards to time, you can rearrange your own schedule, but you still only have 24 hours a day. So the better approach is to outsource and delegate but retain management and control.

For example, rather than spending hours looking searching the internet for deals, create a deal profile that explains exactly what you are looking for and email it to all the agents in the area where you think those properties might exist. That way you will have multiple people looking in multiple areas without costing you a cent!

In regards to money, either join forces with a money partner (someone who has the money but not the time or skill you have to invest it), or else use a leveraged investment technique such as vendor finance, lease options or vendor carry back.

If these terms are new to you, do a google search or even better, grab a hold of the revised edition of my first book and read Chapters 12 to 18.


Now that you've achieved your goal, if you could go back in time, and give yourself one piece of advice that would help you as a property investor, what would it be?
Carpe diem (latin for: seize the day)!

You might not get a tomorrow, so make the most of today.

Seriously, if you don’t like what’s happening, do something about it.

Rarely do things sort themselves out, and all too often we become passive instead of confronting the root issue and resolving it there and then.

Procrastination is like ‘progress cancer’. Luckily there’s an instant cure, if you have the courage to apply it: reassessing, learning, and taking action.


If someone is interested in following in your footsteps to become a property investor - or wants to take their property investing to the next level - what would you recommend they do?
There are three ways I can help.

PropertyInvesting.com

The least costly is by becoming a member of PropertyInvesting.com (it’s free!)

Doing that will help you stay up to date with what I have to say about various investing matters as the property market ebbs and flows.

Books & Seminars

The next level of help I can offer is via reading the books I’ve written and attending my bi-annual live market updates (held in the major capital cities).

Wishing you with all the best of success, and that your investing delivers the life-changing results that I’ve been able to achieve.
